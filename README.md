This script can be used for any election by feeding it raw data in .csv file format similar to the original file provided,
as long as the ballot ID is in column A, county in column B, and candate name is in column C.
The script looks for names and numbers in the spreadsheet and assigns variables based on what it reads in the file. 
Candidate names, county names, and votes can be replaced in the spreadsheet and the script will calculate it all over again.
